# This file was automatically generated by the Cpanel php
# Configuration system.  If you wish to change the way php is being
# handled by Apache on your system, use the
# /usr/local/cpanel/bin/rebuild_phpconf script or the WHM interface.
#
# Manual edits of this file will be lost when the configuration is
# rebuilt.

# These initial handlers serve as fallback in case there is any
#  time between when configuration has changed and when it takes effect.
# We use CGI style since it is simple and the default we use elsewhere.
# If the version is not set to CGI they will get a 404 until the new
#  configuration takes effect which is better than serving source
#  code until the new configuration takes effect.
